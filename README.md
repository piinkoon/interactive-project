# Point and Go!

## Description

With inspiration from travelling mood boards, travel journals, and colorful world maps, this project allows the user to "travel" (or just get future vacation inspiration) on their laptop screen.

## Usage

To navigate this project, simply move your mouse across the page, choose from one of three cities, then click to "go" there! Once inside the city, you can identify two landmark locations of that city and learn more about them.
